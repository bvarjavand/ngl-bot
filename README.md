## NGL : Idle BOT

I built this bot while waiting for my games to progress. As the bot started functioning I was afforded more time to work on the bot. This is the result.

### Installation

Simply clone this directory, and type
`pip install -e .`.

### Usage

Simply take screenshots of the tep-left corder of the game and save it as `ngl-bot/utils/reference.png`.

A few example scripts named `rebirth_beginner.py` and `rebirth_titan.py` may be used easily, or customized to your liking.
